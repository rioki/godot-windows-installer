# Godot Installer

This is an installer for [Godot] by Sean "rioki" Farrell. It is nothing 
official and I am not sure this is useful in a general setting.

## Things To Clarify

This installer assumes you want exactly one version of Godot installed, 
but what about:

- installing different versions of Godot side by side
- installing x86 and x64 side by side
- installing with and without .Net support

[Godot]: https://godotengine.org/
